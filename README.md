# Generic issuer management service

This software is a web server implementing the technical standards as specified in
the ["Swiss Profile"](https://swiyu-admin-ch.github.io/specifications/interoperability-profile/).
Together with the other generic components provided, this software forms a collection of APIs allowing issuance and
verification of verifiable credentials without the need of reimplementing the standards.

The Generic Issuer Management Service is the interface to offer a credential. It should be only accessible from the
issuers internal organization.

As with all the generic issuance & verification services it is expected that every issuer and verifier hosts their own
instance of the service.

The issuer management service is linked to the issuer signer services through a database, allowing to scale the signer
service independently from the management service.

# Deployment

> Please make sure that you did the following before starting the deployment:
>
> - Generated the signing keys file with the didtoolbox.jar
> - Generated a DID which is registered on the identifier registry
> - Registered yourself on the ePortal
> - Registered yourself on the api self service portal

> The steps are explained in the [onboarding to the base and trust registry cookbook](https://swiyu-admin-ch.github.io/cookbooks/onboarding-base-and-trust-registry/)
> Are you a third-party user? Then you're right here! Otherwhise go to [gov internal usage](#Gov-internal-usage)

## 1. Set the environment variables

A sample compose file for an entire setup of both components and a database can be found
in [sample.compose.yml](sample.compose.yml) file.
**Replace all placeholder <VARIABLE_NAME>**.

Please be aware that both the issuer-agent-management and the issuer-agent-oid4vci need to be publicly accessible over
an domain configured in `EXTERNAL_URL` so that
a wallet can communicate with them.

## 2. Create a verifiable credentials schema

In order to support your use case you need to adapt the so-called issuer_metadata (
see [sample.compose.yml](sample.compose.yml#L85)).
Those metadata define the appearance of the credential in the wallet and what kind of credential formats are supported.
For further information consult the [Cookbooks](https://swiyu-admin-ch.github.io/cookbooks/)

## 3. Initialize the status list

Once the issuer-agent-management, issuer-agent-oid4vci and postgres instance are up and running you need to initialize
the status
list of your issuer so that you can issue credentials.

**Request to create an status list slot**  
The url you'll receive in the response will be used in the next request as STATUS_JWT_URL

```bash
curl -X POST https://<SWIYU_STATUS_REGISTRY_API_URL>/api/v1/status/business-entities/<SWIYU_PARTNER_ID>/status-list-entries/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <SWIYU_STATUS_REGISTRY_ACCESS_TOKEN>" \
  -d '{}'


```

The following request needs to be run on your issuer-agent-management instance.

```bash
curl -X POST https://<EXTERNAL_URL of issuer-agent-management>/status-list \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
    "uri": "<STATUS_JWT_URL>",
    "type": "TOKEN_STATUS_LIST",
    "maxLength": 100000,
    "config": {
    "bits": 2
    }
  }'

```

## 4. Issue credential

You're now ready to issue credentials by using the issuer-agent-management API which is accessible under
https://<EXTERNAL_URL of issuer-agent-management>**/swagger-ui/index.html#/Credential%20API/createCredential** to create
a credential offer for a holder. Here is an example of a request body for the offer creation

```json
{
  "metadata_credential_supported_id": [
    # Identifier as configured in the credential_configurations_supported section of the issuer_metadata "myIssuerMetadataCredentialSupportedId"
],
  "credential_subject_data": {
    # Actual content of the credential aka offer data
  "lastName": "Example",
  "firstName": "Edward"
},
"offer_validity_seconds": 86400,
"credential_valid_until": "2010-01-01T19:23:24Z",
"credential_valid_from": "2010-01-01T18:23:24Z",
"status_lists": [
# Url of the status list created in previous step
"https://example-status-registry-uri/api/v1/statuslist/05d2e09f-21dc-4699-878f-89a8a2222c67.jwt"
]
}
```

# Development

> Please be aware that this section **focus on the development of the issuer management service**. For the deployment of
> the
> component please consult [deployment section](#Deployment).

## Setup

- Start application IssuerManagementApplication with local profile

    - Starts docker compose for database
    - Runs Flyway migrations if needed

## Configuration

If you start the application with the local profile as described below, you need to set the credentials for the
status-list api-gateway api in the `application-local.yml` file. The credentials can be obtained from the swiyu
portal. The following properties need to be set:

1. If you have a client key and secret you have to set the following properties in the `application-local.yml` file:

```yaml
swiyu:
  status-registry:
  customer-key: "customer-key"
  customer-secret: "customer-secret"
```

2. If you have a refresh token you have to set the following properties in the `application-local.yml`

```yaml
swiyu:
  status-registry:
    api-url: "https://api-url"
    enable-refresh-token-flow: true
    bootstrap-refresh-token: "your refresh token"
```

> [!NOTE]  
> The values can also be set as environment variables. For more information check
> the [Configuration Environment Variables](#configuration-environment-variables) section.

To start the application locally you can run:

```shell
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=local
```

Note: This spins up a local PostgreSQL database via docker. Once running, Openapi-Documentation can be
accessed [here](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html#/).

### Generate Keys

Currently only EC 256 keys are used.
Generate private key with:
`openssl ecparam -genkey -name prime256v1 -noout -out ec_private.pem`
Remember to keep private keys private and safe. It should never be transmitted, etc.

On the base registry the public key is published. To generate the public key form the private key we can use
`openssl ec -in private.pem -pubout -out ec_public.pem`

### Configuration Environment Variables

The Generic Issuer Agent Management is configured using environment variables.

### HSM - Hardware Security Module

For operations with an HSM, the keys need not be mounted directly into the environment running this application.
Instead, a connection is created to the HSM via JCA. This can be with
the [Sun PKCS11 provider](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/security/pkcs11-reference-guide1.html) or a vendor
specific option.
Note that for creating the keys it is expected that the public key is provided as self-signed certificated.

## Data Structure

```mermaid
erDiagram
    CREDENTIAL_OFFER {
        uuid id PK
        text credential_status
        text metadata_credential_supported_id
        jsonb offer_data
        jsonb credential_metadata
        uuid holder_binding_nonce
        uuid access_token
        integer offer_expiration_timestamp
        text credential_valid_from
        text credential_valid_until
    }

    CREDENTIAL_OFFER_STATUS {
        uuid credential_offer_id PK, FK
        uuid status_id PK, FK
        integer index
    }

    STATUS_LIST {
        uuid id PK
        text type
        jsonb config
        text uri
        text status_zipped
        int last_used_index
        int max_length
    }

    CREDENTIAL_OFFER one to many CREDENTIAL_OFFER_STATUS: "has status"
    STATUS_LIST one to many CREDENTIAL_OFFER_STATUS: "is referenced in"
```

Note: Status List info comes from config and are populated to the DB the first time a Credential uses the status.
ID of the credential offer is also the id used by the issuer adapter (the component communicating with the issuer agent
management) to revoke the credential. It is returned when a new offer is created. It's recommended to save this id to
revoke the credential later on.

### JWT Based Authentication

If there is the need to further protect the API it is possible to enable the feature with a flag and
set the environment variables with the allowed public key as a JSON Web Key Set

    ENABLE_JWT_AUTH=true
    JWKS_ALLOWLIST={"keys":[{"kty":"EC","crv":"P-256","kid":"testkey","x":"_gHQsZT-CB_KvIfpvJsDxVSXkuwRJsuof-oMihcupQU","y":"71y_zEPAglUXBghaBxypTAzlNx57KNY9lv8LTbPkmZA"}]}

If the JWT based authentication is activated it's expected to all in calls be wrapped in a signed JWT with the claim "
data".
The value of the data claim will contain the full json body of the normal request.

Note that this is only affects writing calls.

### Data Integrity Check

To provide a data integrity check with the issuer it is possible to provide the credential subject data as JWT.

See [CredentialOfferCreateJWTIT.java](src/test/java/ch/admin/bj/swiyu/issuer/management/it/CredentialOfferCreateJwtIT.java)
for examples on how to use.

## Credential Status

    REVOKED
    [*] --> OFFERED
    IN_PROGRESS --> OFFERED: reset
    IN_PROGRESS --> ISSUED: issue credential (delete vc data)
    IN_PROGRESS --> EXPIRED: validity posix timestamp exceeded
    OFFERED --> REVOKED: revoke offer
    OFFERED --> IN_PROGRESS: Redeem token
    OFFERED --> EXPIRED: validity posix timestamp exceeded

```

## SWIYU

### Status registry

To use the swiyu status registry to host your status lists you need a registration via ePortal to the swiyu ecosystem.
To get the appropriate credentials please visit the swiyu portal application on ePortal.

For access to the swiyu api you need a refresh token along with your other credentials, please see the `SWIYU_*`
environment variables for further details.

The refresh token can only be used one time, but dont worry: the application does manage the refresh tokens itself.  
But if your issuer agent management component does not run for over a week it might be possible that the refresh token
saved in the database is no longer valid and cannot be used to start the api auth flow.  
If this is the case you need to manually create a new refresh token in the api self service portal and bootstrap your
issuer agent managment component with this token.  
The application does log an appropriate error if it detects such an issue but will still start up.  
Updates to the status registry will fail as long as the auth flow is not restarted with a valid bootstrap token.

#### Setup a local environment

1. Navigate to ePortal
2. Search and select the application **swiyu pro beta**
3. Create a new business partner (scroll to bottom of AGBs)
4. Navigate again to ePortal
5. Search and select the application **API Selfservice Portal**
6. Select the API **swiyucorebusiness_status**
7. Click the blue botton "Abonnieren Sie"
8. Create a new application for this instance
9. Use Customer Key & Secret to configure application-local.yml
10. Onboard via API Gateway (TODO)

## Known Issues

The swiyu Public Beta Trust Infrastructure was deliberately released at an early stage to enable future ecosystem participants. There may still be minor bugs or security vulnerabilities in the test system. We will publish them in the near future as ‘KnownIssues’ in this repository.

## Contributions and feedback

The code for this repository is developed privately and will be released after each sprint. The published code can
therefore only be a snapshot of the current development and not a thoroughly tested version. However, we welcome any
